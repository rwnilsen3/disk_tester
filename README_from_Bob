Installation Dependencies:
pip install psutil


Design:
* Multithreaded server, one thread per client, db writes all done in main thread
* Multi-process clients, one for disk test, one for heartbeats, one for monitoring.
  Communicating via pipes
* Disk tester writes random data to simulate worst case for storage that does compression
  Data written in O_DIRECT mode to isolate disk performance from OS caching effects
* Log performance metrics from each chunk so that one could later build a chart showing disk performance versus time.


Things that could be improved:
* The protocol for communication between clients and would perhaps be better defined rather than rely upon
  typo-prone strings all over the place.
* Unit tests would be nice, but there are so many OS services being called making things yucky
